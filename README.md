### Experiment
This repository is holding the web experiment that was the foundation of my master thesis. It was created on [WEXTOR](https://wextor.eu/wextor/en/), a web-based experiment development platform. The experiment can be downloaded and locally started in a browser for explorative purposes and to support replicability.

To start the experiment, please download all files into a folder and click 'index.html'. You will automatically be assigned to one of the four experimental conditions which are represented by the folders '112acf', '128569', '214da7', and '22ec89'.

### Barplot/consumption data
Further, the script that generated the data for the barplots in the first game of the experiment and that data was added.
